My last day at Brno has come, and I took the bus to Wien Airport, where I later got a plane to Milan.

Overall, this was a very nice experience.
I've met a lot of very interesting people and a lot of people I already knew but only by their IRC and FAS name.
It's always nice to be able to give faces to the names you always read.

I really look forward for the next Fedora Event that probably it will be Flock 2016 for me.
