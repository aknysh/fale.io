### What is a cookie and what is its purpose?
A cookie is a small file that is sent to the browser and saved on your device when you visit a website.
Cookies allow the site to function efficiently and improve its services, in addition to providing information to the site owner for statistical or advertising purposes, primarily to personalize your navigation experience by remembering your preferences (for example, remembering the language and currency you set, in order to recognize you at the next visit, etc.)

### What types of cookies exist?
The cookies can be of different types based on their goal:

* **Technical Cookies**: are those used exclusively with a view to "carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic communications network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said service." They are not used for further purposes and are usually installed directly by the data controller or the website manager. They can be grouped into browsing or session cookies, which allow users to navigate and use a website (e.g. to purchase items online or authenticate themselves to access certain sections); analytics cookies, which can be equated to technical cookies insofar as they are used directly by the website manager to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors and the pattern of visits to the website; functional cookies, which allow users to navigate as a function of certain pre-determined criteria such as language or products to be purchased  so as to improve the quality of service
* **Profiling Cookies**: Profiling cookies are aimed at creating user profiles. They are used to send ads messages in line with the preferences shown by the user during navigation. In the light of the highly invasive nature of these cookies vis-Ã -vis users' private sphere, European legislation requires users to be informed appropriately on their use so as to give their valid consent

Also cookies can be divided in two categories based on the creator of the cookie:
* **First-part cookies**: are created and managed by the website owner
* **Third-part cookies**: are created and managed by a third part

### Which cookies are used by this websire?
Our website uses only **third party cookies**, specifically:

* **Google Analytics** cookies that are anonimized and not used to profile the user. Those cookies fall in the **Technical Cookies** category
* **Disqus** cookies that are not used to profile the user. Those cookies fall in the **Technical Cookies** category

### How can I disable cookies and manage my preferences?
There are many ways to disable cookies:

* Setting the specifications of most browsers allows enabling or disabling the storage of cookies in terminal equipment that is used for browsing the Internet; generally speaking, the relevant rules can be set in such a way as to block "third party" cookies. Some browsers allow users to also block cookies from specific third parties by means of a function that enables only cookies from certain domains
* Specific software ("plug-in software") can be added to a browser in order to specialize browser functions and allow their configuration by users, who can select cookies on the basis of their source domains
