<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9780735664265/cat.gif" width="180" height="220" />After few months after the review of <a href="http://fabiolocati.com/2013/01/comptia-security-rapid-review-exam-sy0-301-by-michael-gregg-microsoft-press/">CompTIA Security+ Rapid Review</a>, I'm now here to speak about it's bigger brother: the Training kit.

With its 569 pages, this book is more than twice the length of the Rapid Review one. Even if someone can think that they did a better summary in the Rapid Review one, I have to say that this is not the case for these two books. While the Rapid Review allows you to pass the exam if you already know the certification contents and you only need to evaluate your level and to refresh some contents, the Training Kit will teach you the certification contents.

This book has 12 chapters, that is a pretty low number for a book of this size, but I think is right for this book since it's developed to be read cover-to-cover, even if it allows a different kind of reading.

I think the biggest downside of this book is the companion disk. It was not usable under Linux (and probably is the same on Mac). I know it's a Microsoft Press book, but since the book topic (Security) and the fact that Linux and Mac are often mentioned in the book, I hoped that the CD would have worked on all the three major platforms.

I would suggest this book to anyone is interested in the CompTIA Security+ exam and in IT Security in general.
